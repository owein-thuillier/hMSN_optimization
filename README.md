# Heterogeneous Multistatic Sonar Networks Optimization Part I & II

In this GitHub repository, we provide free access to experimental results from the articles concerned.

## Part I: Litterature Review and Preliminary Enhancements

For Part I, there is only the following PDF file: 

* [results_part_I.pdf](https://github.com/owein-thuillier/MSN_optimization/blob/main/results/results_part_I.pdf): "naïve" from-scratch evaluation vs. "naïve" update procedures (V1, V2 & V3).

## Part II: Quick Approximation of Detection Probabilities (QADP)

For Part II, there are the following three PDF files: 

* [results_part_II_A.pdf](https://github.com/owein-thuillier/MSN_optimization/blob/main/results/results_part_II_A.pdf):  pre-processing for the QADP method;
* [results_part_II_B.pdf](https://github.com/owein-thuillier/MSN_optimization/blob/main/results/results_part_II_B.pdf): naïve from-scratch evaluation vs. enhanced from-scratch evaluation;
* [results_part_II_C.pdf](https://github.com/owein-thuillier/MSN_optimization/blob/main/results/results_part_II_C.pdf): naïve update procedure (V3) vs. enhanced update procedure (V3).


Some additional information: 

* "naive" refers to reference algorithms that have already been improved compared to the existing state-of-the-art, but serve here as a reference point (i.e. without QADP);
* "enhanced" refers to the same algorithms enhanced with the QADP method;
* the V3 update procedure is the best of the three versions (i.e. V1, V2 & V3).
